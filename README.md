# GetMyPublicIp
Applicatio to know dynamic public IP 

I wrote this small windows workflow application which is hosted on a windows service.

This will automatically send a email to your email account whenever the public IP get change of its hosted machine.

Why would someone use it ?

Let's say you don't have a static IP and what you have is a Dynamic IP assign by your ISP. You have setup small web site, remote desktop, NAS , FTP, Network Camera or whatever you need on this network.

To access any of above from a outside network you need to know the IP address and when you are away you don't have a way to find it. If you have installed this service then you can get know the IP by simply checking your email.

Any Alternatives ?

Can use Free DDNS service providers, but these free service are not very efficient. There are paid DDNS providers also but i have not use those.
